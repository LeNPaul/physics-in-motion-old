# Physics in Motion (Old)

Website design for Physics in Motion, a site intended to provide students with an intuitive understanding of physics through interactive web applications. 

This was a temporary site while the full-stack application was being developed. Please check out the repository for current release of [Physics in Motion](https://github.com/LeNPaul/physics-in-motion).
