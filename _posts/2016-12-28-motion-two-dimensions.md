An object moving with constant velocity will always move in a straight line, unless the object is accelerated in a different direction. If this acceleration occurs along the line of motion, then the object will remain moving in a straight line (although its velocity will change).

If the body accelerates, but not along the line of motion, then the direction of that object will change. It will no longer be a straight line, and will instead follow a curve. The result is motion in two-dimensions.

The motion of an object in two-dimensions can be described by two position functions. For example, \\( x(t) \\) and \\( y(t) \\), for the x-axis and the y-axis on the Cartesian plane, respectively. The position of a point-like object can then be given by the co-ordinate pair, \\( ( x(t), y(t) ) \\), or as a vector:

$$
  \vec{r}(t) = x(t) \hat{i} + y(t) \hat{j},
$$

where \\( \hat{i} \\) and \\( \hat{j} \\) are unit vectors pointing in the x and y-axes, respectively. The two directions are independent of each other, as they are perpendicular axes (moving along the x-axis does not affect movement along the y-axis, for example).

As with the case of motion in one dimension, the velocity of an object is the rate of change of its position:

$$
  \vec{v} (t) = \frac{d \vec{r} (t)}{dt}.
$$

In Cartesian co-ordinates, that gives us:

$$
  \vec{v} (t) = v(t)_{x} \hat{i} + v(t)_{y} \hat{j},
$$

where,

$$
  v_x (t) = \frac{d x(t)}{dt},
$$

and,

$$
  v_y (t) = \frac{d y(t)}{dt}.
$$

Similarly, we have acceleration as the rate of change of the velocity:

$$
  \vec{a} (t) = \frac{d \vec{v} (t)}{dt} = \frac{d^2 \vec{r} (t)}{dt^2}.
$$

Or, in Cartesian co-ordinates, that gives us:

$$
  \vec{a} (t) = a(t)_{x} \hat{i} + a(t)_{y} \hat{j},
$$

where,

$$
  a_x (t) = \frac{d v_x(t)}{dt},
$$

and,

$$
  a_y (t) = \frac{d v_y(t)}{dt}.
$$

It is usually more convenient to denote a vector using brackets, as follows:

$$
  \vec{v} = v_x \hat{i} + v_y \hat{j} = (v_x, v_y).
$$

Both notations mean the same thing, and are used as convenient.
