### Near Earth Gravity

Near the surface of the earth, all objects are attracted to the earth with a constant force given by:

$$
  F = -mg
$$

Where \\( m \\) is the gravitational mass, and \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to the earth's gravity, which for most cases can be approximated by \\( g = 9.8 m/s^2 \\), where the negative sign exists as a result of choosing the upwards direction as being positive. The force an object feels due to the local gravitational force is known as the object's weight.

It is important to understand that there is a difference between the gravitational mass of an object, which is an intrinsic quantity of that object, and the weight of that same object, which depends on the local gravitational field, which is an extrinsic quantity. That is why a person would weigh less on the moon, for example, since the moon is much smaller than the earth. In both cases though, the person's mass remains the same.

When analyzing the force diagrams of an object near the surface of the earth, we can conclude that:

$$
  F = ma = - m g \rightarrow a = - g
$$

In other words, the acceleration of that object is therefore constant, and pointing downwards, which we would expect. For most applications, taking \\( g \\) to be a constant is a good approximations, although do realize that the value of \\( g \\) in fact varies on the earth's surface, and depending on how far from the surface you are. A more accurate description of the force of gravity can be described by Newton's law of universal gravitation, which we will cover later.
