## Projectile Motion

A type of motion that is often encountered in practical applications of kinematics is projectile motion, the path an object that is thrown on earth follows as it moves through space. For simplicity, we will ignore air resistance.

In the case of projectile motion, if we were to choose our coordinate system such that the x-axis is parallel to the ground, and the y-axis is perpendicular to the ground, then we have the object being accelerated along the y-axis towards the ground, in the negative direction:

$$
  a_x (t) = 0
$$

$$
  a_y (t) = -g
$$
