Due to drag and friction, simple harmonic motion will generally not persist unless aided by an external force. If we denote such an external force by \\( F_{ext} \\), then the equations of motion for the spring take the form

$$
  F_{tot} = -k x(t) + F_{ext} = m \frac{d^2 x(t)}{d t^2}
$$

The solution to this equation depends on the precise form of F_{ext}, and we will now consider a couple of important examples.

### Constant External force

Consider a mass \\( m \\) hanging vertically from the ceiling by a spring with spring constant \\( k \\). Take the downwards direction to be positive. The equation of motion then takes the form
