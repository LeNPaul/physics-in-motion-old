Throughout this section, we will use \\( \theta \\) and \\( \phi \\) to represent angles in general. Angles are measured in radians unless otherwise stated.

The fundamental relation of trigonometry, which is another way of stating Pythagorus' Theorem is,

$$
  \cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1
$$

A few important relations of cosines and sines are,

Periodicity:

$$
  \cos(\theta \pm 2 \pi) = \cos \theta
$$

$$
  \sin(\theta \pm 2 \pi) = \sin \theta
$$

Symmetry:

$$
  \cos(-\theta) = \cos \theta
$$

$$
  \cos(\pi/2 - \theta) = \sin \theta
$$

$$
  \sin(-\theta) = - \sin \theta
$$

$$
  \sin(\pi/2 - \theta) = \cos \theta
$$

The angle addition formulas state,

$$
  \cos(\theta_1 + \theta_2) = \cos(\theta_1)\cos(\theta_2) - \sin(\theta_1)\sin(\theta_2)
$$

$$
  \sin(\theta_1 + \theta_2) = \sin(\theta_1)\cos(\theta_2) + \cos(\theta_1)\sin(\theta_2)
$$

From these two formulas several other formulas follow. First are the double angle formula you are probably familiar with

$$
  \cos 2 \theta = \cos^2 \theta - \sin^2 \theta
$$

$$
  \sin 2 \theta = 2 \sin\theta \cos \theta
$$

Also, by taking linear combinations of the above, you can arrive at the following formulas for the additions of sines and cosine functions (useful when discussing the interference of waves).

$$
  \sin \phi_1 + \sin \phi_2 = 2 \sin \left( \frac{\phi_1 + \phi_2}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{\phi_1 - \phi_2}{2} \right)
$$

$$
  \cos \phi_1 + \cos \phi_2 = 2 \cos \left( \frac{\phi_1 + \phi_2}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{\phi_1 - \phi_2}{2} \right)
$$

Any other formula can be obtained with some of the defining relations of cosines and sines.
