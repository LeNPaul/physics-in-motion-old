### Functions

Functions are a mapping from some sets of numbers to another set of numbers. This simplest type of functions are ones that take a single variable, like \\( f(x) \\). This function, \\( f(x) \\), takes as argument a single number and returns a single number. For example,

$$
  f(x) = \frac{1}{2} k x^2
$$

Where \\( k \\) is some constant. The independent variable \\( x \\) may have many different meanings and symbolic representations. Similarly, the function \\( f(x) \\) my be represented by many other symbols. But, the meaning is always the same: you give it some number \\( x \\) and it will give you some other number \\( f(x) \\). A few examples are,

Some function of time \\( t \\)

$$
  f(t)
$$
