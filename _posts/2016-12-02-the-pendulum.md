So far, \\( x(t) \\) has been discussed as the linear displacement from equilibrium. But simple harmonic motion is not restricted to linear motion. Consider a long string of length \\( l \\) and negligible mass that is used to hang an object of mass \\( m \\) from the ceiling. This is known as a pendulum. Unperturbed, the object remains in equilibrium along the vertical with the pull of gravity downwards balanced against the tension of the string upwards.

Suppose the object is displaced so as to make an angle \\( \theta \\) with the vertical. The forces are still gravity and the string's tension, but a horizontal component is now present due to the string tension that acts to push the object back towards the vertical. When the angle is small, the displacement in the vertical is negligible and we can write Newton's second law for the component of the force acting in the vertical,

$$
  0 = - mg + T \cos(\theta (t)) \rightarrow T = mg / \cos(\theta(t))
$$
