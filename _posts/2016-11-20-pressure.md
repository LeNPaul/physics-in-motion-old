Certain types of fluids, known as incompressible fluids, can be analyzed using Newton's laws to determine the behaviour of such fluids.

The pressure applied on an object is the force per unit area perpendicular to the surface,

$$
  P = \frac{F}{A}
$$

Where \\( F \\) is the applied force and \\( A \\) is the area onto which it is applied. The standard unit of pressure is the Pascal and it is defined as,

$$
  1 \ Pa = \frac{N}{m^2}
$$

Maybe the most familiar example of pressure is atmospheric pressure caused by the weight of the atmosphere (recall that weight is a fore). Air, albeit very light still has a mass. If we consider a column of air of cross-sectional area of \\( 1 \ cm^2 \\), starting at sea level and extending all the way up to the atmosphere, that column weighs \\( W = 10.1 \ N \\), and hence that entire column has a mass of about \\( W / g = 1 \ Kg \\). It exerts a pressure of \\( 1.01 \times 10^5 \ Pa \\), also known as 1 atmosphere.
