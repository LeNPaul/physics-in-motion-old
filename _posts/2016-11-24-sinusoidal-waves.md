A very particular form for the general function describing a wave, \\( f(x - v_w t) \\), is known as a sinusoidal wave,

$$
  y(x,t) = A \sin (k x - \omega t + \phi)
$$

Where \\( \omega \\) is the angular frequency and \\( k \\) is known as the wave-number. This function is periodic in both time and space. Concentrating on a particular point along the x-axis, say \\( x = 0 \\), we see that the point in the string is executing a simple harmonic motion about the equilibrium position,

$$
  y(x_0,t) = A \sin(\omega t)
$$

You can prove that \\( y(0, t + 2 \pi / \omega) = y(0,t) \\), and so the period of this motion is

$$
  T = \frac{2 \pi}{\omega}
$$

This sinusoidal wave also exhibits spatial periodicity, repeating itself at a distance:

$$
  \lambda = \frac{2 \pi}{k}
$$

Where \\( \lambda \\) is kown as the wavelength. Indeed, you can show that at any given moment, say \\( t = t_0 \\), we have \\( y(x + \lambda, t_0) = y(x,t_0) \\). If it is a wave, then it must have some velocity, which can obtain by writing

$$
  y(x,t) = A \sin k (x -\frac{\omega}{k} t)
$$

Comparison with the defining equation of a general wave, we see that

$$
  v_w = \frac{\omega}{k} = \frac{\lambda}{T} = f \lambda
$$

The velocity of a sinusoidal wave is its frequency times its wavelength.

### Power and Intensity

The power of a wave, which is the rate that energy is transported by the wave, has units of \\( kg m^2 / s^2 \\). For a wave on a string, there are four independent quantities that carry units, the mass density \\( \mu \\) with units of \\( kg/m \\), the wave speed \\( v_w \\) with units of \\( m/s \\), the amplitude of the wave \\( A \\) with units of \\( m \\), and the angular frequency \\( \omega \\) with units of \\( s^{-1} \\). We expect the power to be delivered at the same rate as the wave is propagating, hence \\( P \propto v_w \\). Also, on dimensional grounds, the power must involved one power of the mass density \\( P \propto \mu \\) because of the units associated with mass. Therefore, against on dimensional grounds we can conclude that the power in a wave must be,
