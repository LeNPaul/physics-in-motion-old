If we know the position as a function of time, \\( \vec{r} (t) \\), for all the bodies in the system, then we have solved the dynamics of the system completely, and we know all of its past, present, and future motion.

If all of the forces in the problem are specified, it is possible to find this solution through a careful analysis of the equations of motion. However, in many cases, we can easily identify certain quantities which remain constant through the motion, and are independent of time. These quantities are known as constants of motions, and they are useful since knowing their value at any moment, we know their values at all times, irrespective of their motion. One such example was work conservation, where conservative forces are involved.

Another constant of motion is known as momentum. Newton's second law applies to a single body states that,

$$
  \vec{F} = m \vec{a} = \frac{d \vec{p}}{dt}
$$

Where in the last step, \\( \vec{p} = m \vec{v} \\). This is a vector quantity known as the momentum. In general, it is a function of time. However, if any of the components of the force vanishes, then the corresponding component of the momentum is conserved:

$$
  0 = \frac{d p_i}{dt} \rightarrow p_i = constant
$$
