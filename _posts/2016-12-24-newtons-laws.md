When we study kinematics, we assume that we already know everything about the position function, \\( x(t) \\), and from there, we can calculate the velocity and acceleration. In most cases, we do explicitly know the position function, and must determine \\( x(t) \\), based off of the forces that are interacting with an objects, which are often easier to measure.

### First Law of Motion

In the absence of any forces, the acceleration of an object is zero. This results in the velocity of an object remaining unchanged. If the velocity of the object was zero, or unmoving, then it will remain so. If the velocity of the object was nonzero, then it will remain traveling in a straight line.

In the case where \\( \vec{F} = 0 \\), there are two possibilities where this is the case.

### Second Law of Motion

The effect of forces on the motion of an object are described by Newton's second law of motion:

$$
  \vec{F}_{tot} = m \vec{a}
$$

Where \\( \vec{a} \\) is the acceleration of the object, \\( m \\) is the inertial mass, and \\( \vec{F}_{tot} \\) is the total force acting on the object, given by the following:

$$
  \vec{F}_{tot} = \vec{F}_1 + \vec{F}_2 + ... = m \vec{a}
$$

The standard unit for measuring forces is called a Newton, where

$$
  1 N = kg \times m/s^2
$$

By knowing the total force, \\( \vec{F}_{tot} \\), as a general function, we know everything about the kinematics of the system, as well as the time. By itself, the second law does not provide us with that the general function of force is. This has to be determined based on the context of the system, primarily through experimentation.

## Third Law of Motion
