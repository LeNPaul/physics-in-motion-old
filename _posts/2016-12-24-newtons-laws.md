When we study kinematics, we assume that we already know everything about the position function, //( x(t) //), and from there, we can calculate the velocity and acceleration. In most cases, we do explicitly know the position function, and must determine //( x(t) //), based off of the forces that are interacting with an objects, which are often easier to measure.
