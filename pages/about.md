Education is not something that you can ever finish, and should never stop once you complete school.

Unfortunately, traditional school values have raised people to view learning as a chore, something that you *only* do a means to end. Many canâ€™t wait until they finish school so that they can stop studying for school and start working at a job.

My goal is to change this, and to demonstrate that learning is something that should be done for its own sake. In particular, the study of physics often gets a bad reputation for being a difficult and even boring subject to study (it isn't!).

Physics in Motion is a free online resource for learning physics, whether you are a student learning physics in school, or an enthusiast looking to learn something new, this site offers a comprehensive resource for learning physics how it was meant to be taught.
